# DH110 - Assignment 02

## Satsuki Liu - DGT HUM 110 @ UCLA, Spring '23

### Introduction
Chess Universe, as outlined in my [previous assignment](https://github.com/SNTPG/DH110/blob/main/Assignment%2001/README.md), is a decent mobile application to play multiplayer chess, either locally or over multiple devices, but it is not without its flaws. Namely, during my heuristic evaluation of it, I found that it was most lacking in the fields of **user control and freedom** and **help and documentation.** Namely, it is incredibly obtuse to try to remove some vestigial features that are not part of base-game chess (i.e. "boosters" and "hints") in some game modes, and actual documentation and assistance for navigating between different menus is sparse to nonexistent. However, this is based solely on my own evaluation, and thus, I am employing **usability testing (UT)** as a greater endeavor to find what the true UX might be for this application.

### Purpose
As touched upon in the paragraph above, the reason I am using **UT** for this app is to confirm (or deny) my findings in the previous assignment. I am unsure if I was being particularly nitpicky in my findings, or on the inverse, if I was too slack in my evaluation of some other categories. Hopefully, by hosting this pilot UT of the application, I can find if testers have similar issues with the UX that I anticipate, which would further my own goals of designing a better UX experience for board game applications for mobile devices.

### Methodology
The usability test was conducted in my apartment at my desktop. A webcam was used for recording as the tester filled out the Google Form on a Google Chrome browser, and testing was done on my OnePlus 11 phone. Recording was done via the built-in Android screen recorder for app interaction, and OBS was used for the part of the test on the computer. This pilot test was conducted with me as a moderator and my roommate as a user. I designed four tasks for my testers to examine:
1. Playing a tutorial game against an AI
2. Playing a chess puzzle
3. Playing a blitz game against a random human
4. Inviting a friend to download the app
I would have preferred to conduct this test in a quieter place, but unfortunately, I do not have reasonable access to an alternative location because I do not currently have a laptop computer, and as such, I was limited to my apartment with my desktop computer.

### Findings
The most obvious finding I had in doing this assignment is that I did not prepare my Google Form well enough. Due to a browser cache issue, previous test input data was left in the fields, and by the time I had realized the reason for this, it was too late to restart the experience because my tester had already seen some of the tests I provided him. Furthermore, I found that some of my wording in the tasks was not perfectly clear. While I intentionally asked him to find the "puzzle section" of the game to see if he could equate that with the "Chess Academy" in the game, which understandably led to confusion, I did not anticipate that by describing "Garry's Keep" as "the Kasparov set," he might not understand what I meant. I had expected that he would experiment with the application and menus a bit more than he did in reality, and I found that he gave up quicker than I expected. On the other hand, his actions align with my expectation that the application's explanation of rapid vs. blitz vs. bullet chess is insufficient and out of place, as he did not even notice the button to pull up additional information on the online menu. Overall, I feel like I have learned how to write a better UT by disambiguating my intentions in writing, as well as providing more guidance in my form where I might otherwise feel that it is implied.
