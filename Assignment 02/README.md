# DH110 - Assignment 02

## Satsuki Liu - DGT HUM 110 @ UCLA, Spring '23

### Introduction
Chess Universe, as outlined in my [previous assignment](https://github.com/SNTPG/DH110/blob/main/Assignment%2001/README.md), is a decent mobile application to play multiplayer chess, either locally or over multiple devices, but it is not without its flaws. Namely, during my heuristic evaluation of it, I found that it was most lacking in the fields of **user control and freedom** and **help and documentation.** Namely, it is incredibly obtuse to try to remove some vestigial features that are not part of base-game chess (i.e. "boosters" and "hints") in some game modes, and actual documentation and assistance for navigating between different menus is sparse to nonexistent. However, this is based solely on my own evaluation, and thus, I am employing **usability testing (UT)** as a greater endeavor to find what the true UX might be for this application.

### Purpose
As touched upon in the paragraph above, the reason I am using **UT** for this app is to confirm (or deny) my findings in the previous assignment. I am unsure if I was being particularly nitpicky in my findings, or on the inverse, if I was too slack in my evaluation of some other categories. Hopefully, by hosting this pilot UT of the application, I can find if testers have similar issues with the UX that I anticipate, which would further my own goals of designing a better UX experience for board game applications for mobile devices.

### Methodology
The usability test was conducted in my apartment at my desktop. A webcam was used for recording as the tester filled out the Google Form on a Google Chrome browser, and testing was done on my OnePlus 11 phone. Recording was done via the built-in Android screen recorder for app interaction, and OBS was used for the part of the test on the computer. This pilot test was conducted with me as a moderator and my roommate as a user. [MORE PENDING]
