# DH110 - Assignment 06

## Satsuki Liu - DGT HUM 110 @ UCLA, Spring '23
This assignment is dedicated to designing the UI and layout of my project.

## Description
Through personal experience, anecdotal evidence, and user research, I have conjectured, and consequently verified, that a common activity that families use to connect with each other is playing board games. However, whether in-person or over the Internet, common pitfalls in gameplay often come down to difficulty explaining the rules of the game or inability to interface with real-world analogues. Thus, my proposed application seeks to provide users with an intuitive user interface that should make it easy for users of all ages to search up and access various board games, as well as play them, which I will not be extensively modelling but nonetheless demonstrating a severely limited mockup.

As I have explained already in countless emails, I am in a state where it is physically painful to do much beyond lie in bed, so this assignment, unfortunately, like its predecessors, is woefully unfinished. I am turning it in for minimal partial credit at this point. My apologies, Dr. Cho.

## Figma File
[Here](https://www.figma.com/file/MmlQK8HKhxU5z8IVgiOM92/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=4M3dpuIjffMgMOWg-1) is the Figma file in which I did my work. It is woefully unfinished, but alas. I do not have a complete digitized wireflow yet.

## Design Process

I intentionally misaligned the metadata with the image because the gutter spacing looked weird.

## Testing
Due to sickness, I did not conduct any user testing. My apologies. I will comment, however, that *I* am personally off-put by the shape variation with rounded corners and/or beveled edges, as I feel though while they make the app seem more "inviting," it seems a little too goofy to be using an app for a reference manual and avenue for board games. Overall, I think I'll keep with the professional-feeling presentation for the remainder of the project, if I can catch up in time.

## Design system recap
Currently, I am using the default Figma font, Inter, for most of my UI, though I do intend to change that after consulting with a friend who is a hobbyist in font design. All buttons are presented in 30px, with the exception of the PLAY! button, which is 48px. Text fields are presented as 16px, and the search bar is also presented in 16px. I plan to make the tutorial and rules pages utilize 20px for headings and 12px for paragraphs.

For the color scheme, I selected a muted aquamarine mostly on a whim, and I do intend to try to switch to a more earthy color palette later on, in order to evoke images of wooden chessboards and other physical board game aspects. For now, the primary color used was #CFFDFB for the background, with #AAEDEA, #00AD9D, and #008A7B used as progressively darker shades of this hue, according to Material Design's calculator. I have chosen a largely blocky presentation for the UI because it is both simple and intuitive, as well as thematically in-line with the purpose of the project: board games, which are often arranged in gridlike fashions.
