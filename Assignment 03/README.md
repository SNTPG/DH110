# DH110 - Assignment 03

## Satsuki Liu - DGT HUM 110 @ UCLA, Spring '23
This assignment is dedicated to field research in my ongoing project of attempting to make a mobile application for board games as a vector for family connection.

### Introductory steps
#### 1. Specify the research goal & requirements
**What is the main activity your project would support for the users?**
> This project is dedicated to helping users play board games with each other. Ideally, it would support both a mentor role and a learner role such that users of any experience level, be it in board games or the technology to use the app itself, would be able to use the app in a seamless fashion such that the app itself does not impede upon the goal of having fun as a family.

**What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?**
> The basic need/goal for this activity is first of all to have a platform by which a board game can be hosted, as well as providing additional resources for troubleshooting, learning, etc.

**What are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
> For single-use board games such as chess, there are readily available websites and applications such as *Chess.com* and *Lichess* that users can play with each other on. *Tabletop Simulator*, readily available through Steam, allows a sandbox-like experience for users to interact with objects in a three-dimensional space, which is the application of choice for virtual board gamers everywhere.

**What are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?**
> *Chess.com* and *Lichess* are single-game sites, so if a family wanted to branch out and try different games, they would have to seek an alternative website or app. *Tabletop Simulator* costs $20 on Steam and thus is not as accessible to users, especially since it must be purchased for every playing user, and it is additionally only able for desktop, not mobile. Furthermore, its keybinds and general UI are unintuitive, with a significant learning curve that would prove very problematic for grandparents.

#### 2. Target users
What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme)
> For the research I am conducting, I am targeting teenagers and young adults because of their relative expertise in playing and hosting board game sessions. User research with a grandparent might prove difficult, as older individuals as a cohort tend to be less adept with technology than their younger counterparts, and field research on their activities would likely end up being in-person observation with physical boards, which is not exactly helpful to my project. I am anticipating that an average teenager might be more tech-savvy and culturally knowledgeable and therefore be more in-tune with popular board games.

In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?
> Put most simply, users would want to play board games to pass the time, have fun, or spend quality time with friends or family. It is a recreational activity and thus has fun at its core.

What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
> To play board games, users either have to have a physical board game or software for digitally emulating it, and have a set of other users to play the game with. There is boilerplate setup to be had with boards and applications, as well as a decent amount of explanation of the rules to new users, which reinforces my research into the more experienced ro

#### 3. Pick an qualitative research method (or a combination/adaptation of methods) 
**...by covert / overt observation?**
> I am using overt observation for this assignment, as there's no use to be gained from keeping observation under wraps. I want to see how a user sets up and plays board games, and in fact, overt observation might even be more beneficial, as playing board games often is a very public activity when it comes to activities such as tabletop RPGs, the gamemaster becoming even theatrical in the process.

**...by active / passive / participatory interaction?**
> I am using participatory interaction for this field research assignment, as for my third activity of hosting an online game of *Blood on the Clocktower*, I will assume the role of a co-storyteller so that I can see the view of a storyteller as opposed to a normal player.

#### 4. Plan the details
**Brainstorm the right contexts and narrow down to decide where to visit physically and/or virtually**
> I will be conducting this interview through a Discord video call for the majority of the process. Recording is done through OBS, and any user-side view of their computer was consensually shared through Discord's streaming feature. Given that most of the use cases for younger adults playing board games with each other virtually are done in a VoIP application, Discord is a logical choice for this activity.

**Decide what activities to observe**
> Through correspondence with my friend Alex, who is a board game aficionado and avid storyteller for *Blood on the Clocktower*, I have decided to observe three activities.

1. Set up an online game of *Twilight Imperium IV* for a group of friends.
2. Set up an in-person game of *Blood on the Clocktower* for seven people.
3. Play a ten-person game of *Blood on the Clocktower* online.

>The last activity is a separate recording in a different Discord VC, as Alex had scheduled an actual game session at noon on Sunday, and I did not wish to interrupt the process of either the game or the interview, as the game session was slated to last for three hours and thus I only recorded the setup as a separate video.

Decide how to interact with the users
> I decided to actively observe Alex for the first two activities, while for the third, he graciously allowed me to take on the in-game role of co-storyteller for the *Blood on the Clocktower* game, which allowed me to record the moderation tools of the website he used.

**Decide how to collect user data**
> I did not make use of notes in real-time, as I recorded the entire process using OBS Studio. Discord's streaming and camera features allowed me to take a comprehensive record of these activities.

### Insights

**When playing board games, what do you seek out of the experience?**
Part 1, 3:02 - Mainly, when I play board games, as fun as it is to compete against other people, I mainly like playing them for the social experience and being able to interact directly with people in a way that you don't normally get through just by conversating [sic] with them. Being able to you know, have a little banter while you're strategizing with or against people, or being able to applaud someone on a victory well done or take your own victory and start hoisting it above their heads, holding the trophy up high. It's always fun.

**What are the most major differences between playing board games in person and virtually, and what sort of obstacles do you face in either medium?**
Part 1, 4:25 - The biggest difference I've noticed when playing board games across different mediums is that when playing digitally, sometimes depending on the environment used specifically in *Tabletop Simulator*, it's hard to replicate some of the same actions that you would do in real life because I think tactility is an important part about physical board games, how pieces feel, how they fit in your hands, how you can draw cards, like sometimes those systems are difficult to get right digitally. And especially sometimes when you do try to get it right and sometimes users it can be unintuitive. I've had dozens of times where my friends are playing Tabletop Simulator, they just forget how to draw cards, and it's a nightmare.

**What is the best way to teach someone a new board game?**
Part 1, 8:06 - I've found that the best way to teach people how things work is to show them a visual example whether just so that they can see how it's done so they can understand or they can see how it's done. So that they can have an idea of what it looks like so they can replicate it easier in the future. Being able to just have free access to how, like, the mechanisms of whatever game you're playing, to be able to give examples of that whenever necessary when teaching is very effective.

**Are there any obstacles to using *Tabletop Simulator* you could see, especially for someone in their sixties?**
Part 1, 23:37 - ...by virtue of it being a digital medium that already makes it somewhat complicated, but especially with something like *Tabletop Simulator*, where a lot of the functionality is behind keybinds, or right click menus, and it's not very easily presented. Like the only thing that would really, I think make sense for somebody to do for the first time they open a game is to look around and, like, click buttons that make numbers go up and drag things around, maybe, and move them around [...] I don't think there's a better way to implement it, but I do still think it's a challenge for less technologically experienced people to be able to play efficiently in a medium like this. 

**If you could create a magical tool that would allow you to play board games as you want, what would such a tool be? How would it work? What areas would it cover?**
Part 1, 38:07 - ...because I am always a firm believer that tactility is really important when it comes to board games, and even when it comes to understanding a board game, especially in games that have more complicated components, or more complicated functions, players just being able to hold something in their hands just increases understanding a lot? So, in a perfect world, this magical tool would allow players to have their own physical representation of what they're playing that would update with whatever movements that other people make to it, across whatever Internet connection they have.

### Reflection
This experience with field research has been very informative, and having done it, I feel like I am better equipped to assess user wants and use cases now. A lesson I learned pretty immediately is that sticking to a script in the strictest sense is pretty impossible, and I found myself inventing new questions on the fly to further my understanding of the way Alex hosts board game sessions. The process of participating in interacting with his activities was very helpful, as I feel I have a very intuitive understanding of why he makes the decisions he does, i.e. why he enjoys certain applications and websites, as well as the types of features that users like him might seek in an application. His final remarks about his "magical tool" really emphasize the importance of teaching regarding board games, so his comments will be very helpful to me as I continue to assess what would make a good board game application, explicitly for the purposes of family connection.
