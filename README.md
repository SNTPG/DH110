# DH110
Satsuki Liu's repository for DGT HUM 110 @ UCLA, Spring '23.

This repository will be used for the assignments provided by Dr. Cho throughout the course of this quarter. The objective of this project is to explore UI/UX design in a human-centered design process, and over the course of ten weeks, I will be posting my work here. Currently, the creation of this markdown file is to fulfill the requirements of the third activity for the first week.
